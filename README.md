## What is this?

**CogSec Checker** is a web app that analyzes a user's recent X (Twitter) posts to assess their "cognitive security" (CogSec) profile. The app uses the Grok API from xAI to generate a brutally honest, witty, and offensive roast, mapping the user on a 2D plane:

- **Y axis:** Gullible (+10) to Skeptical (-10)
- **X axis:** Oversharing (+10) to Paranoid (-10)

All in good fun‚Äîthis site is for entertainment purposes only!
